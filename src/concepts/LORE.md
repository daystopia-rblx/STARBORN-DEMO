**1. Ascendium**
A world where death is certain, but ascension is earned.
    • The name of the world and the philosophical foundation of the game.
    • Reflects the soul-looping nature of the game—death isn’t the end, but neither is survival easy. Every return is a test.

**2. Awakening**
The act of rebirth.
    • When a player dies, they “Awaken” again, stripped of their progress but retaining knowledge, experience, and in rare cases, echoes of their past (cosmetic marks, or lore-based perks).
    • Ties into a lore mechanic: maybe characters are “Awakened” by a hidden force or an Authority testing them.

**3. Ascension**
The endgame goal. A permanent transcendence above the cycle of Awakening.
    • Could be tied to multiple paths (e.g., defeating a great Authority, mastering all Invocations, or unifying certain relics).
    • Players can’t “Ascend” unless certain hidden conditions are met.
    •    Once Ascended, characters are no longer playable but become echoes in the world—potential NPCs, bosses, or lore.

**4. Invocation**
Audible rites that channel power through sequences.
    • Each Invocation is a casted phrase or motion that channels power through the Authority it’s bound to.
    • Sequences matter: doing them wrong can backfire. Doing them right in rhythm or succession builds effects.
    • Think: combo chains mixed with spellcasting and visual/audio flair.
    • Players might learn higher-tier Invocations through scrolls, tomes, or through interaction with shrines of the Authority.

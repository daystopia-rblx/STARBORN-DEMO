### **1. Meaningful Choices & Branching Dialogue**

- **Description**:
  Allowing players to make decisions that have significant consequences on the world and NPC interactions is vital to creating an engaging dialogue system. These choices should influence the world, NPCs, and the player’s journey, giving the player control over the story and creating a sense of agency.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario**: The player is tasked with deciding the fate of a town after its corrupt leader is overthrown.
  - **Choice 1:** **"Help the townspeople rebuild and lead them toward prosperity."**
    - Result: The player gains **respect** from the town, receives quests to assist in rebuilding, and forms alliances with local factions.
  - **Choice 2:** **"Take control of the town for yourself."**
    - Result: The player becomes the new ruler, gaining power but alienating former allies, leading to potential rebellions or enemies.
  - **Choice 3:** **"Burn the town to the ground and leave it in ruins."**
    - Result: The town is destroyed, and the player faces heavy consequences, like loss of reputation, betrayal from allies, and a new faction seeking revenge.

### **2. Dynamic NPC Interaction (Personality, Mood, and State)**

- **Description**:
  NPCs should feel alive with unique personalities that shift over time based on player actions and the state of the world. Their reactions and mood should be affected by the player's behavior, the history between them, and the broader events taking place.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario**: The player approaches an NPC merchant who initially distrusts them.
  - **Mood 1: Suspicious:** "You don’t look like the type to be here. What do you want?"
    - The player’s **hostility or past actions** have caused the NPC to be wary.
  - **Mood 2: Friendly:** "Ah, you’ve been helping the townspeople. I’ve got some new items for you. Come take a look."
    - If the player has **built a relationship** with the NPC, they now receive special offers or discounts.

### **3. NPCs with Evolving Dialogue & Personal Growth**

- **Description**:
  NPCs should not remain static but evolve based on the player’s actions, forming bonds or rivalries that deepen the player’s connection to the world. NPCs should grow, change their outlook, and possibly offer new storylines or quests based on how they’ve been influenced.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario**: The player befriends a young, inexperienced warrior who starts as an NPC quest giver.
  - **Early Interaction:** "I’ve just begun training. I don’t think I’m strong enough to help you, but maybe one day I’ll prove my worth."
  - **Mid-Game Interaction (after player helps them):** "I’m getting stronger, thanks to you. I’ve learned a lot. One day, I’ll fight beside you."
  - **Late-Game Interaction (after player’s influence):** "I’ve become a warrior, just like you. Maybe now, I can join your cause and help you on your journey. But I have a decision to make... Should I stay here and protect this place, or follow you?"
    - The NPC grows in strength and character, eventually offering to join the player’s quests or even act as a **rival** depending on how the player handled their development.

### **4. Player-driven Dialogue Timing (Real-time Interactions, Interruptions, and Pacing)**

- **Description**:
  Giving the player control over the flow of conversation makes interactions feel more dynamic. Allowing real-time options to interrupt, delay responses, or change the pace of the conversation enhances the feeling of player agency.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario**: The player speaks with an NPC about an important event.
  - **Interrupting Dialogue:** The player interrupts the NPC's long-winded monologue to say, "I’ve heard enough. Get to the point."
    - Result: The NPC might become **angered**, cutting off the conversation and resulting in a **lost quest** or **hostility**.
  - **Delaying Response:** If the player takes too long to respond, the NPC may assume disinterest and say, "You’ve been standing there for a while. Do you even care about this?"
    - Result: This can affect the player's **reputation** with the NPC.

### **5. Multi-layered Dialogue Choices (Main vs. Side Conversations)**

- **Description**:
  Offering multiple layers of conversation (main plot, lore, personal stories, and optional side dialogues) keeps the dialogue rich and varied. Players should be able to explore deeper elements of the world and characters through side conversations.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario**: The player is speaking to a faction leader.
  - **Main Dialogue:** "We need to decide whether to defend the city or abandon it. What will you choose?"
  - **Side Dialogue:**
    - **Option 1:** "Tell me about your past before leading this faction."
      - Result: The faction leader shares personal stories, opening up new quests or **backstory** elements.
    - **Option 2:** "Is it true that you once betrayed your allies for power?"
      - Result: The faction leader reacts with **anger**, causing the relationship to sour but revealing **hidden truths** that could affect future events.

### **6. Emotional Impact & NPC Reactions (Based on Past Interactions)**

- **Description**:
  NPCs should react emotionally to the player’s past actions. These reactions should influence ongoing dialogue and create a lasting impact on the player’s relationship with the NPCs and the world at large.
- **Example**:
  **Scenario:** The player approaches a former ally who was betrayed.
  - **Betrayed NPC Reaction:**
    - "You... You have the nerve to show your face after what you did? Get out of here!"
      - The NPC’s emotional response reflects the **betrayal**. They refuse to help the player and may even warn others to avoid them.
  - **Forgiveness Option:**
    - "I can’t believe you came back to apologize. Maybe you can make it up to me..."
      - If the player **apologizes** or **shows remorse**, the NPC might be willing to forgive them and offer help or **special rewards**.

### **7. Conflict Resolution & Diplomacy:**

- **Description:** Not all interactions should lead to violence. Providing players with opportunities to resolve conflicts diplomatically enhances the depth of the world and gives them more ways to solve problems.
- **Example:**
  **Scenario:** The player is in a situation where two factions are about to engage in war.
  - **Choice 1:** **"I’ll mediate and try to bring peace."**
    - Result: The player uses dialogue to propose a treaty. They might succeed in ending the conflict, gaining the **favor** of both factions and **unlocking diplomatic quests**.
  - **Choice 2:** **"Let them fight. I’ll take the spoils."**
    - Result: The player chooses not to intervene, but this leads to **chaos** and changes the landscape of the game world, creating enemies and causing NPCs to view the player as ruthless.

### **8. NPC Knowledge & Reputation (World Reaction to Player):**

- **Description:** The player's actions should be remembered by the world. NPCs will react differently depending on their knowledge of the player's deeds, whether good or bad, creating a world that feels organic and responsive.
- **Example:**
  **Scenario:** The player enters a town where their reputation has preceded them.
  - **Positive Reputation:**
    - NPC: "Ah, I’ve heard of your deeds. You saved the village from that band of raiders. How can I help you?"
      - The player receives **discounts**, **special quests**, or helpful information from NPCs who trust them.
  - **Negative Reputation:**
    - NPC: "You? I’ve heard about what you did to the last town. You’re not welcome here."
      - NPCs are wary, making it **harder** to find allies or gain access to important areas.

### **9. Lore & World-building Through Dialogue:**

- **Description:** NPCs should provide rich backstory and lore, offering players deeper insights into the world’s history and opening up new quests and areas to explore.
- **Example:**
  **Scenario:** The player speaks to an ancient scholar about the origins of the world.
  - **Option 1:** "Tell me about the **First War of Ascendium**."
    - Result: The scholar recounts a **rich backstory**, revealing lore that deepens the player's understanding of the world and might unlock new quests or locations.
  - **Option 2:** "What happened to the **Sunken Kingdoms**?"
    - Result: The scholar reveals **hidden knowledge** about ancient civilizations, and the player learns about **long-forgotten ruins** that could be explored.

### **10. Real-Time Conversations (Dialogue Flow & Natural Interactions):**

- **Description:** Conversations should feel natural, with the player able to adjust the flow by interrupting or delaying responses, making the experience feel more fluid and reactive.
- **Example:**
  **Scenario:** The player interrupts an NPC mid-sentence.
  - NPC: "And so, after we fought through—"
    - Player interrupts: **"I don’t have time for your story."**
      - Result: The NPC grows **angry** and gives the player a **shorter response**, possibly cutting off a questline or relationship.
  - Alternatively, letting the NPC finish their story might reward the player with **additional lore** or **hidden items**.

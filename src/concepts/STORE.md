## 🧿 **Store System Breakdown**

### 1. 📦 **Store Types**

Each store should feel **purposeful**, not just a place to buy anything.

- **General Stores** – Basic tools, food, survival items
- **Invocation Shops** – Sell Invocation scrolls, fragments, or tomes
- **Smithies** – Craft, repair, and upgrade gear using resources
- **Relic Traders** – Deal in high-value or cursed items, only found in hidden areas
- **Blood Merchants** – Rare NPCs dealing in forbidden arts (Blood-for-items)
- **Guild-Specific Stores** – Locked unless you’re part of that faction or guild
- **Black Markets** – Spawn only at night or in unstable regions

---

### 2. 🔄 **Dynamic Inventories**

- **Stock Rotation** – Changes daily or weekly, with rare events increasing supply/demand
- **Event-based Stock** – Weather, world bosses, or zone changes alter what’s sold (e.g., after a town is attacked, healing supplies go up in price)
- **World-linked Progression** – Players unlocking dungeons, slaying world bosses, or contributing resources can **upgrade the town store’s level**

---

### 3. 🧠 **Merchant Identity & Dialogue**

Every merchant has:

- A name, background, and maybe even **rumors or sidequests**
- Their own **preferences** and **biases** (e.g., refuses to sell to certain races or offers better prices to specific factions)
- A **morality rating** (some will report theft, others won’t care)

Examples:

- **Vethra the Whisperer** – Sells cursed relics, only opens shop after you find her name through an Invocation
- **Tornus, Exiled Varkoth** – Sells massive weapons, but only to those with a high PvP kill count

---

### 4. 💰 **Advanced Buying & Selling**

- **Haggling System** – Skill-based mini game or stat check (e.g., Charisma, Luck, or a rare Invocation that charms)
- **Bartering** – Offer items instead of Umbrels—merchants value different things (e.g., rare bones for a Blood merchant)
- **Reputation Scaling** – Prices shift based on your renown or infamy
- **Bulk Buy / Sell UI** – With inventory weight, item preview, and compare stats

---

### 5. 🕵️ **Stealing & Sabotage Mechanics**

- Can **pickpocket**, **bribe**, or **distract** to steal from shops
- Some stores have **guards**, **magical wards**, or **echoes** that remember thieves
- If you’re caught? You get:
  - **Marked by the Authority**
  - Fined, jailed, or even **bounty hunted** by local NPCs or players

---

### 6. 📈 **Economy Influence**

- **Guilds can control regions** and set tax rates on stores in their territory
- **Trade routes** can be discovered and protected—if bandits cut them off, store prices rise
- Players can even **invest in or supply stores**, which changes what’s available and gives them a **cut of profits**

---

### 7. 📱 **Immersive Store UI**

- **Tabs** for each item category (Weapons, Invocations, Food, Misc)
- **Visual previews** of gear, armor, and weapons on your character
- **Compare** new items to your equipped ones
- Filters for rarity, type, Authority-bound, Bloodbound, etc.

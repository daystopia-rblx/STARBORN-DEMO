**Ascendium Farming System**

1. **Farming Mechanics**
   • Till soil (prepare ground for planting)
   • Plant seeds (different seeds have different requirements)
   • Water crops (maintain moisture levels)
   • Apply fertilizer (boost growth rate and quality)
   • Harvest (timing affects yield and quality)
   • Crop rotation (planting strategy for soil health)

2. **Crop Types (Growth Time)**
   • Fast Crops (1-2 game days)
   • Medium Crops (3-5 game days)
   • Slow Crops (6-10 game days)
   • Special Crops (Varies)

3. **Farming Locations**
   • Home Garden (Small starter plots)
   • Community Farms (Shared spaces with communal benefits)
   • Premium Farmland (Purchasable larger plots with soil bonuses)
   • Special Growing Areas (Cave farming, greenhouse, hydroponics)
   • Wild Cultivation (Finding and nurturing wild plants)

4. **Tool Progression**
   • Beginner Tools (Basic hoe, watering can, scythe)
   • Quality Tools (Faster work, larger area coverage)
   • Enchanted Tools (Special properties like auto-watering or yield bonuses)
   • Mechanized Equipment (Late-game automation for large farms)
   • Specialized Tools (Crop-specific tools for optimal results)

5. **Crop Usage**
   • Cooking (Ingredients for recipes with various buffs)
   • Crafting (Materials for dyes, textiles, and decorations)
   • Trading (Valuable export goods for merchants)
   • Medicine (Ingredients for healing items and status effect remedies)
   • Animal Feed (Sustaining livestock for additional resources)
   • Seed Production (Converting mature crops to seeds for sustainability)

6. **Skill Integration**
   • Farming Skill Level affects:
     - Crop quality and yield
     - Tool efficiency and area of effect
     - Crop growth time
     - Unlocking special crop varieties
     - Soil quality management
   • Cross-skill benefits with:
     - Cooking (better ingredient recognition)
     - Herbalism (improved medicinal properties)
     - Animal Husbandry (integrated farm management)

7. **Time and Weather Effects**
   • Seasons determine which crops can grow
   • Rain reduces need for manual watering
   • Drought increases water requirements
   • Storms may damage crops without protection
   • Temperature affects growth rate and disease resistance
   • Special events (Blood Moon, Solar Eclipse) for unique growing conditions

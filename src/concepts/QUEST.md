### **1. Quest Types**

- **Main Quests**:
  Core story-driven quests that push the overarching narrative forward. Completing these quests reveals deeper secrets about the world of _Ascendium_ and the player's place within it.
  - **Example**: **“The Lost King’s Heir”** – Discover the secret heir to a fallen kingdom and decide whether to restore the throne or let it fade into history.
- **Side Quests**:
  Optional but impactful quests that provide world-building, character development, and rewards. These quests are tailored to the player’s decisions and alliances.
  - **Example**: **“Grim Reaper’s Favor”** – Help a notorious NPC with a personal quest, unlocking lore and unlocking new alliances or rivalries.
- **Faction Quests**:
  Exclusive quests tied to the various factions in _Ascendium_. Completing these will impact your standing with factions, unlock special rewards, and shape the world.
  - **Example**: **“A Thief’s Betrayal”** – Assist the Thieves' Guild in taking down a betrayer within their ranks, resulting in either greater power within the faction or a bitter rivalry.
- **Dynamic Quests**:
  These quests are procedurally generated based on the player’s actions, reputation, and the state of the world. They evolve and adapt based on the player’s choices and the ongoing world narrative.
  - **Example**: After aiding a village, a new quest might appear to defend it from an impending attack or assist with its reconstruction.

### **2. Quest Structure & Narrative Depth**

- **Branching Dialogue Choices**:
  Dialogue during quests should have significant impact, with branches that change the direction or outcome of the quest. These can affect NPC reactions, alter the rewards, or open new storylines.
  - **Example**:
    - **Option 1**: “Help the villagers, they deserve protection.”
      - Result: Players gain loyalty from the village, opening new opportunities for trade and alliance.
    - **Option 2**: “I don’t have time for them. Let them fend for themselves.”
      - Result: The village is destroyed, and the player gains notoriety, but new, darker quests become available.
- **Multiple Outcomes**:
  Quests should have multiple possible outcomes, driven by the player’s decisions and actions. These outcomes should be far-reaching, affecting the narrative, NPCs, and the world.
  - **Example**:
    - The player is tasked with deciding whether to save an important artifact from being destroyed or letting it fall into the hands of enemies. The decision may result in gaining a powerful item or gaining the ire of a dangerous faction.
- **Consequences for Failure**:
  Failing a quest or making certain decisions should have lasting consequences. Some quests may become **unavailable** based on the player’s previous actions, leading to a sense of regret, but also creating a **more organic world** where choices matter.
  - **Example**:
    - A quest to protect a faction from betrayal fails. This could permanently alter the faction’s standing in the world and the player's ability to work with them.

### **3. Quest Rewards & Progression**

- **Unique Rewards**:
  Every quest should offer rewards that go beyond just items or currency. These rewards can include **new abilities**, **character progression**, **lore unlocks**, and **faction influence**.
  - **Example**:
    - Completing a quest for an ancient mage may unlock new magic abilities or grant **rare knowledge** that enhances your character's powers.
- **Legacy Rewards**:
  In _Ascendium_, the impact of quests extends beyond a single character. Completing certain quests may leave a legacy that benefits future characters through items, lore, or even the discovery of **hidden areas**.
  - **Example**:
    - A character who successfully completes the "Legacy of the Fallen Hero" quest will unlock **special items** or locations for their descendants to explore in future playthroughs.

### **4. Quest Givers & NPCs**

- **Dynamic NPC Quest Givers**:
  NPCs should have evolving roles in the world, with some offering quests based on the player’s reputation, past interactions, or storyline progress. Players should also have the ability to **influence NPCs**, making their decisions matter.
  - **Example**:
    - An NPC initially offers a low-level quest, but after forming a strong bond or completing other faction quests, the same NPC may offer more complex and rewarding missions.
- **Hidden Quest Givers**:
  Some quest givers may not be immediately apparent. Players will need to explore, talk to NPCs, or uncover hidden storylines to unlock these quests. These could be tied to the **lore** or **secrets** of the world.
  - **Example**:
    - A reclusive NPC, who only appears under specific conditions or after an event, could offer quests that reveal **deep world lore** and grant powerful items or abilities.

### **5. Quest Tracking & Clarity**

- **Clear Quest Log with Context**:
  The quest log should provide clear details about active and completed quests, with reminders about important decisions, NPCs, and places to visit. The journal should also highlight **key dialogue choices**, **failed quests**, and **current goals** for easy tracking.
- **World-Integrated Quest Information**:
  Instead of relying on static quest logs, quests should be seamlessly integrated into the world. NPCs, objects, or locations should serve as visual reminders or **hints** about ongoing quests, making the world feel alive and interconnected.
  - **Example**:
    - If the player has a quest to find a lost artifact, NPCs may drop clues about its location as they continue their conversation.

### **6. Quest Complexity & Player Agency**

- **Complex, Multi-stage Quests**:
  Many quests should span multiple stages, incorporating puzzles, combat, exploration, and decision-making, allowing players to experience a variety of gameplay styles and approaches.
  - **Example**:
    - A quest to infiltrate a stronghold might require gathering information, speaking to potential informants, gathering disguise items, and navigating traps, before finally engaging in combat.
- **Player-Driven Quest Choices**:
  Allow the player to approach quests in different ways, whether through **combat**, **stealth**, **diplomacy**, or **problem-solving**. Quests should give players a lot of freedom in how they complete objectives.
  - **Example**:
    - A quest to retrieve a stolen item can be completed through combat (stealing it back from the thief), stealth (sneaking in and recovering the item), or diplomacy (convincing the thief to give it back).

### **7. Faction-Based & World-Shaping Quests**

- **Factional Influence**:
  The player's actions in quests should influence faction standings, opening up new questlines or locking others behind a **reputation** wall. Aligning with certain factions should also offer specific **rewards** and **lore**.
  - **Example**:
    - Helping one faction rise to power could cause another to fall, reshaping the political landscape of the world.
- **World-State Changing Quests**:
  Quests should not only affect the player but also the larger world. Decisions made in quests should change the world in **tangible ways** (such as a town being destroyed or a faction taking over).
  - **Example**:
    - A quest that helps build or destroy a city could result in that city becoming either a bustling hub of commerce or a forsaken ruin.

### **8. Quest Replayability & Procedural Generation**

- **New Game Plus & Replayable Quests**:
  After finishing the main storyline, quests should remain replayable in new game modes or "New Game+" style progression, with different outcomes based on different decisions.
  - **Example**:
    - After completing a questline, new quests may become available in New Game+, offering different outcomes based on the player's earlier decisions.
- **Procedurally Generated Quests**:
  While major quests remain structured, side quests and certain world events can be procedurally generated to offer dynamic content that responds to the world’s state or the player's choices.
  - **Example**:
    - Depending on where the player is in the world, random quests could pop up, like defending a caravan or tracking down a dangerous fugitive who only appears after the player has made certain choices.
